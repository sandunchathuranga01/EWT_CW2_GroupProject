 Smart waste management system

Project Proposal

1.1 Waste Management System 

Waste production rises in tandem with population growth and economic expansion. The current waste management systems are under more pressure because they might not be sufficiently prepared to handle the growing volumes of waste. Inadequate planning, funding, and implementation of waste management can lead to serious issues. The public's awareness, government regulations, infrastructure investments, technological advancements, and modifications to industrial and individual behavior are frequently needed to address waste management issues. To reduce waste's detrimental effects on the environment, healthcare, and resource conservation, sustainable waste management techniques are crucial. Because of that, we came up with an idea to build up a solution to this major issue. So as a solution, we are going to build up software and hardware to Implement the problem.

1.1.1 Project Background and Stats

One of the main issues in our Community is waste management. The amount of waste produced has significantly increased due to changing consumption patterns, rising urbanisation, and growing populations. There are numerous issues with the region's current waste management procedures, making an effective, long-lasting, and ecologically friendly waste management system imperative.

The lack of public awareness and education regarding waste reduction and appropriate waste management procedures is another problem with waste management in metropolitan settings. Many locals are ignorant of the negative effects of incorrect trash disposal and are unaware of the advantages of recycling or composting. As a result, many people still leave trash lying around or just leave it as litter on the streets. This puts nearby residents' health at risk in addition to contributing to environmental degradation.

•	 Waste Production Worldwide: Every year, the global municipal solid trash generated amounts to about 2.01 billion metric tons. If current trends continue, it is predicted that the world's garbage generation will reach 3.40 billion metric tons annually by 2050.

•	Waste Production per Capita: Countries differ greatly in the average amount of garbage generated per person; in certain low-income countries, it can be as low as 0.11 kg per day, while in high-income nations, it can reach as high as 4.54 kg per day.

•	 Plastic Refuse: Every year, the world produces about 300 million tons of plastic waste. 79% of plastic trash ends up in landfills, dumping sites, or the environment. Only 9% of plastic garbage is recycled, and 12% is burned.

•	 Electronic Waste: The total amount of electronic garbage (e-waste) produced worldwide in 2019 was estimated to be 53.6 million metric tons. At a projected 21% annual growth rate by 2030, e-waste is the waste stream that is expanding the quickest.

•	Effect on Health: Maladies including dengue fever, cholera, and respiratory ailments can spread as a result of improper garbage disposal. Inadequate handling of hazardous waste can seriously endanger the health of neighbouring communities.

1.1.2 Examples of the problem

As an example, we can mainly aim at urban areas like Children's parks, Government departments and even we can get public transportation routines like railway stations, beaches, religious places, historical sites etc.

•	Parks for Children: In addition to being ugly and possibly dangerous for young ones, visitors frequently leave trash, food containers, and other rubbish in the park. A hazardous and dirty park might result from poor waste management.

•	Ministries of Government: Excessive production of paper waste and general office waste is common in government offices. If this waste is not adequately managed, it can result in congested and disorganised workspaces, which lower productivity and promote a wasteful culture.

•	Railway stations and other public transportation routes: Rail stations can become dirty and unsightly places for commuters and tourists to carelessly discard their rubbish, which makes travelling and commuting unpleasant.

•	Seashores: Unresponsible beachgoers frequently abandon garbage and other non-biodegradable objects there. Both the natural beauty of the beach and marine life may be harmed by this garbage.

•	Sites of Religion: Offerings, candles, and other materials can become garbage during religious rites and gatherings. These locations risk being crowded and desecrated, losing their holiness, if they are not properly maintained.

•	Historical Places: Litter and graffiti are occasionally left by tourists and visitors in historical places, defacing these priceless cultural landmarks and lowering their historical and aesthetic worth.

1.1.3 Attempted solutions for the competitors

Numerous stakeholders have launched several initiatives and solutions in response to the urgent problems brought on by the increasing amount of waste in our area. The establishment of waste collection schedules, the enforcement of recycling laws, and the imposition of fines for inappropriate waste disposal are all the results of government-led initiatives. To engage the local population, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and community groups have planned recycling drives, clean-up events, and awareness campaigns. In addition, technological solutions have surfaced, such as the use of mobile applications that allow citizens to report waste-related issues and the installation of smart bins with Internet of Things sensors for real-time monitoring.

2. Proposed Solution

The suggested software and hardware solution will be essential in addressing the problems brought on by the rising amount of waste produced and the shortcomings in the waste management systems in place today. User-friendly interfaces, effective waste collection scheduling with IoT integration for real-time monitoring, machine learning-assisted waste sorting and categorization, and a comprehensive recycling information hub are all included in the comprehensive plan. In addition, it offers comprehensive information on waste disposal locations as well as assistance with composting and safe handling of hazardous waste. Schedules, updates, and emergencies are communicated to users through a strong notification system. Data-driven insights are provided to users through reporting and analytics, which include predictive modeling for waste generation patterns. 

3. Target Audience

A waste management system is under two grant parties. They can be referred to as waste garbage generators and waste collectors. 
Household consumers can be identified as a group that needs a solid waste management system. These are people who generate household waste. They are the end users of the waste management system and are directly affected by their proper disposal and recycling to minimise waste.
Another party includes businesses, factories and offices that generate waste. Specific equipment management service needs are tailored to their specific industries.
A waste management system is also supported for educational institutions and places of worship.
The local government is often responsible for implementing and managing waste management within its jurisdiction. They are the primary stakeholders who collect, dispose recycle and regulate waste.
